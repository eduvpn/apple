		"This privacy statement applies to the open source Let’s Connect! VPN software. References to 'we', 'our' and 'us' refer to Commons Caretakers b.v., while 'you' and 'your' refer to the user of Let’s Connect!. The most recent version of this privacy policy can always be found at https://letsconnect-vpn.org/privacy.html.",

		"We believe (the opportunity to have) privacy in a secure way is fundamental but unfortunately also increasingly scarce. Let's Connect! strengthens the user's security by allowing users to deploy Let’s Connect! VPN server and connect to this server via the client apps. Let's Connect! has been developed with privacy and security in mind since the very beginning of the project because we think privacy and security are inseparable within Let's Connect!.",
		"",
		"That being said, Let's Connect! software doesn’t log ANY personal data. A user may deploy their own server and turn on/off default server logging. We will never receive any logging. This Let's Connect! client won’t send us ANY personal information. Only when apps crash we might get crash logging from for example the Apple App Store.",
		"",
		"Be aware",
		"",
		"This app is used to create VPN tunnels to Let’s Connect VPN servers. We don’t have control of these servers, or their registration in the app, we only provide open-source client with sane privacy and security defaults. Before you create a VPN tunnel to a Let’s Connect VPN, it is your responsibility to check the privacy and security policy of that particular server."

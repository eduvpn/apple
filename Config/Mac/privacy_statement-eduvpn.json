        "We believe (the opportunity to have) privacy in a secure way is fundamental but unfortunately also increasingly scarce. eduVPN has been developed with privacy and security in mind since the very beginning of the project because we think privacy and security are inseparable within eduVPN. Educational and/or research institutes can deploy their own eduVPN server and be in control of security and privacy aspects. ",
        "",
        " The eduVPN client doesn’t log ANY personal data. Only when apps crash we might get crash logging from for example the Apple Appstore.",

        "Be aware",
        "",
        "This app is used to create VPN tunnels to eduVPN servers. We provide meta-data which enables you to find your own educational or research institute easily. We don’t have control of these eduVPN servers,  we only provide open-source software with sane privacy and security defaults. Before you connect a VPN tunnel to an eduVPN server, it is your responsibility to check the privacy and security policy of that particular server."

# TunnelKit

This library provides a generic framework for VPN development and a simplified Swift/Obj-C implementation of the OpenVPN® protocol for the Apple platforms. The crypto layer is built on top of [OpenSSL 1.1.1][dep-openssl], which in turn enables support for a certain range of encryption and digest algorithms.

## Getting started

The client is known to work with [OpenVPN®][openvpn] 2.3+ servers.

- [x] Handshake and tunneling over UDP or TCP
- [x] Ciphers
    - AES-CBC (128/192/256 bit)
    - AES-GCM (128/192/256 bit, 2.4)
- [x] HMAC digests
    - SHA-1
    - SHA-2 (224/256/384/512 bit)
- [x] NCP (Negotiable Crypto Parameters, 2.4)
    - Server-side
- [x] TLS handshake
    - Server validation (CA, EKU)
    - Client certificate
- [x] TLS wrapping
    - Authentication (`--tls-auth`)
    - Encryption (`--tls-crypt`)
- [x] Compression framing
    - Via `--comp-lzo` (deprecated in 2.4)
    - Via `--compress`
- [x] Compression algorithms
    - LZO (via `--comp-lzo` or `--compress lzo`)
- [x] Key renegotiation
- [x] Replay protection (hardcoded window)

The library therefore supports compression framing, just not newer compression. Remember to match server-side compression and framing, otherwise the client will shut down with an error. E.g. if server has `comp-lzo no`, client must use `compressionFraming = .compLZO`.

### Support for .ovpn configuration

TunnelKit can parse .ovpn configuration files. Below are a few details worth mentioning.

#### Non-standard

- Single-byte XOR masking
    - Via `--scramble xormask <character>`
    - XOR all incoming and outgoing bytes by the ASCII value of the character argument
    - See [Tunnelblick website][about-tunnelblick-xor] for more details

#### Unsupported

- UDP fragmentation, i.e. `--fragment`
- Compression via `--compress` other than empty or `lzo`
- Connecting via proxy
- External file references (inline `<block>` only)
- Static key encryption (non-TLS)
- `<connection>` blocks
- `vpn_gateway` and `net_gateway` literals in routes

#### Ignored

- Some MTU overrides
    - `--link-mtu` and variants
    - `--mssfix`
- Multiple `--remote` with different `host` values (first wins)
- Static client-side routes

Many other flags are ignored too but it's normally not an issue.

## Installation

### Requirements

- iOS 11.0+ / macOS 10.15+
- SwiftPM 5.3
- Git (preinstalled with Xcode Command Line Tools)

It's highly recommended to use the Git package provided by [Homebrew][dep-brew].

### Caveats

Make sure to set "Enable Bitcode" (iOS) to NO, otherwise the library [would not be able to link OpenSSL][about-pr-bitcode].

Recent versions of Xcode (latest is 13.1) have an issue where the "Frameworks" directory is replicated inside application extensions. This is not a blocker during development, but will prevent your archive from being validated against App Store Connect due to the following error:

    ERROR ITMS-90206: "Invalid Bundle. The bundle at '*.appex' contains disallowed file 'Frameworks'."

You will need to add a "Run Script" phase to your main app target where you manually remove the offending folder, i.e.:

    rm -rf "${BUILT_PRODUCTS_DIR}/${PLUGINS_FOLDER_PATH}/YourTunnelTarget.appex/Frameworks"

for iOS and:

    rm -rf "${BUILT_PRODUCTS_DIR}/${PLUGINS_FOLDER_PATH}/YourTunnelTarget.appex/Contents/Frameworks"

for macOS.

### Demo

Download the library codebase locally:

    $ git clone https://github.com/passepartoutvpn/tunnelkit.git

There are demo targets containing a simple app for testing the tunnel, called `BasicTunnel`. Open `Demo/TunnelKit.xcodeproject` in Xcode and run it on both iOS and macOS.

For the VPN to work properly, the `BasicTunnel` demo requires:

- _App Groups_ and _Keychain Sharing_ capabilities
- App IDs with _Packet Tunnel_ entitlements

both in the main app and the tunnel extension target.

In order to test connectivity in your own environment, modify the file `Demo/Demo/Configuration.swift` to match your VPN server parameters.

Example:

    private let ca = CryptoContainer(pem: """
	-----BEGIN CERTIFICATE-----
	MIIFJDCC...
	-----END CERTIFICATE-----
    """)

Make sure to also update the following constants in the same files, according to your developer account and your target bundle identifiers:

    public static let appGroup
    public static let tunnelIdentifier

Remember that the App Group on macOS requires a team ID prefix.

## Documentation

The library is split into several modules, in order to decouple the low-level protocol implementation from the platform-specific bridging, namely the [NetworkExtension][ne-home] VPN framework.

Full documentation of the public interface is available and can be generated by opening the package in Xcode and running "Build Documentation" (Xcode 13).

### TunnelKitCore

Contains the building blocks of a VPN protocol. Eventually, a consumer would implement the `Session` interface, expected to start and control the VPN session. A session is expected to work with generic network interfaces:

- `LinkInterface` (e.g. a socket)
- `TunnelInterface` (e.g. an `utun` interface)

There are no physical network implementations (e.g. UDP or TCP) in this module.

### TunnelKitManager

This component includes convenient classes to control the VPN tunnel from your app without the NetworkExtension headaches. Have a look at `VPNProvider` implementations:

- `MockVPNProvider` (default, useful to test on simulator)
- `NetworkExtensionVPNProvider` (anything based on NetworkExtension)

### TunnelKitAppExtension

Provides a layer on top of the NetworkExtension framework. Most importantly, bridges native [NWUDPSession][ne-udp] and [NWTCPConnection][ne-tcp] to an abstract `GenericSocket` interface, thus making a multi-protocol VPN dramatically easier to manage.

### TunnelKitIKE

Here you find `NativeProvider`, a generic way to manage a VPN profile based on the native IPSec/IKEv2 protocols. Just wrap a `NEVPNProtocolIPSec` or `NEVPNProtocolIKEv2` object in a `NetworkExtensionVPNConfiguration` and use it to install or connect to the VPN.

### TunnelKitOpenVPN*

#### Protocol

Here are the low-level entities on top of which an OpenVPN connection is established. Code is mixed Swift and Obj-C, most of it is not exposed to consumers. The protocol implementation in particular depends on OpenSSL.

The entry point is the `OpenVPNSession` class. The networking layer is fully abstract and delegated externally with the use of opaque `IOInterface` (`LinkInterface` and `TunnelInterface`) and `OpenVPNSessionDelegate` protocols.

#### AppExtension

Another goal of this area is packaging up a black box implementation of a [NEPacketTunnelProvider][ne-ptp], which is the essential part of a Packet Tunnel Provider app extension. You will find the main implementation in the `OpenVPNTunnelProvider` class.

A debug log snapshot is optionally maintained and shared by the tunnel provider to host apps via the App Group container.

#### Manager

On the client side, you manage the VPN profile with the `OpenVPNProvider` class, which is a specific implementation of `NetworkExtensionVPNProvider`.
